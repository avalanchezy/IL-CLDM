## 1. Summary of the Model

The following shows the training procedure for our proposed model

<img src= image\framework.png>

The image-and-label conditioning latent diffusion model (IL-CLDM) is proposed to synthesize Aβ-PET scans from MRI scans for providing a reliable MRI-based alternative of classifying Aβ as positive or negative. The proposed model incorporates both image and label conditioning modules into the denoising network for preserving subject-specific and diagnosis-specific information.

## 2. Setup instructions and dependancies

For training/testing the model, you must first download ADNI dataset. You can download the dataset [here](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/). Also for storing the results of the validation/testing datasets, checkpoints and loss logs, the directory structure must in the following way:

    ├── data                # Follow the way the dataset has been placed here
    │   ├── whole_Abeta        # Here Abeta-PET images must be placed
    │   └── whole_MRI          # Here MR images must be placed
    │   └── latent_Abeta       # This can be empty since the encoding process will generate these latent representations of original Abeta-PET images
    ├── data_info          # Follow the way the data info has been placed here
    │   ├── data_info.csv       # This file contains labels for each ID
    │   ├── train.txt           # This file contains the ID of training dataset, like '037S6046'
    │   └── validation.txt      # This file contains the ID of validation dataset
    │   └── test.txt            # This file contains the ID of test dataset
    ├── result             # Follow the way the result has been placed here
    │   ├── exp_1              # for experiment 1
    │   │   └── CHECKPOINT_AAE.pth.tar      # This file is the trained checkpoint for AAE in the first stage
    │   │   └── CHECKPOINT_Unet.pth.tar     # This file is the trained checkpoint for Unet in the second stage
    │   │   └── loss_curve.csv              # This file is the loss curve for two stages
    │   │   └── validation.csv              # This file is the indicator files for two stages in the validation set
    │   │   └── test.csv                    # This file is the indicator files for two stages in the test set
    ├── config.py          # This is the configuration file, containing some hyperparameters
    ├── dataset.py         # This is the dataset file used to preprocess and load data
    ├── main.py            # This is the main file used to train and test the proposed model
    ├── model.py           # This is the model file, containing two models (AAE and Unet)
    ├── README.md
    ├── utils.py           # This file stores the helper functions required for training

## 3. Running the model

Users can modify the setting in the config.py to specify the configurations for training/validation/testing. For training/validation/testing the our proposed model:

```
python main.py
```
